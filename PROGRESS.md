<ul>
  <li>11:05. I need to draw lines as the ball moves in space</li>
  </li>20:03 Solved the quadratic path projectile issue but there is still some features to be added onto it</li>
<li>20:46 Getting closer to making the simulation more real world based 30/09/25</li>
<li>21:44 Finished the projectile for now. I will add more details and stuff over time but not immediately</li>
<li>22:14 6/10/25. Moving on the another simulation, equilibrium</li>
<li> 20: 33 09/10/25. Just finished the necessary equilibrium part</li>
<li>21: 13 Now creating the moment and torque simulation</li>
<li>14:18 12/10/25 Created the pivot for the moment Simulation and also have making started some documentation</li>
<li>21/11/25 22:26 Making rotations when weights are added</li>
