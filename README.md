<h1>Simulations</h1>

<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>This project is a cumulative project. It probably doesn't have a definite end for easily, there are countless of simulations out there from physics to maths, to chemistry to computer science. The goal isn't to do all, but as many as possible with my area of knowledge.</p>
<p>I create the functionality part of a simulation and then use a GUI to allow the program to be much more user friendly in so many ways, for instance, data entry</p>
<p>Over time this project will be built upon more and more features and ideas would be made but for not (09/10/25), it should only be the essentials</p>
